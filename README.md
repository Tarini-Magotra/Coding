Hangman Game is an interactive console-based project built in C++ for GitHub. This classic word-guessing game challenges players to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. Users interact through input prompts and receive feedback on correct or incorrect guesses, displayed through ASCII art that represents the hangman's scaffold. The project employs object-oriented programming principles, including classes for game logic and user interaction. With a user-friendly interface, it offers an entertaining and engaging experience, encouraging players to improve their vocabulary while enjoying a nostalgic game. The repository includes clear documentation and code for seamless understanding and contribution.
